# Personal-Blog
üìÑ Personal Blog Website
This is a modern, responsive personal blog website built with a minimalist design aesthetic. The site is a single-page application (SPA) that uses client-side rendering to navigate between different pages without reloading.

‚ú® Features
Clean Design: A sleek, modern design using a sophisticated color palette of white, gray, and black.

Dynamic Content: Articles are dynamically loaded and displayed on the home page.

Article Search: A search bar allows users to find articles by title, excerpt, or content.

Tag Filtering: You can filter articles by specific tags to find relevant content.

Responsive Layout: The design adapts seamlessly to all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Theme Toggle: Easily switch between a light and a dark theme.

Client-Side Routing: Navigate between the home, about, and contact pages instantly without a full page refresh.

Real-time Comments Section: Each article page includes a functional comments section where users can leave a message.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure and content.

CSS3: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach and a fully responsive layout.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Powers all the dynamic functionality, including content rendering, navigation, searching, and the theme toggle.

üöÄ How to Run
Since this is a single HTML file with all the code included, it is very easy to run.

Save the code as a single file, for example, index.html.

Open the file directly in your web browser.

No server or additional setup is required!

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Persistent Data: Implement a backend database like Firestore to save articles, comments, and newsletter subscriptions permanently.

User Authentication: Add user accounts so people can log in and manage their comments or even create their own articles.

Admin Panel: Build a content management system (CMS) to easily add, edit, or delete blog articles.

More Interactivity: Add a "Like" button to articles or a feature to share them on social media.
